</ul>

<p><img src="/static/images/kill-chain.png" alt="Intrusion Kill Chain" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill chain&rdquo; sounds ominous, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_chain">originally used as a military concept related to the structure of an attack</a>&rdquo;.  Bill mentions others that have been re-purposed for cybersecurity, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone">DMZ</a>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">Firewall</a> came from the barrier between the (dangerous) steam engine and the people in a the locomotive.</p>

<p>Viruses and worms seem to have a more organic origin.  We have anti-virus, but no innoculation (or is that what patching is?)</p>

<p>Funny to think what names could have stuck, e.g., &ldquo;web application <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockade">stockade</a>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Question from a classmate: How to get into cybersecurity?</p>

<ul>
<li>Knowledge of basics &ndash; take this class :-)</li>
<li>Certifications</li>
<li>Experience from other domains, two popular routes: infrastructure (networking or sysadmin) or application dev</li>
</ul>

<p>Where do Mac addresses come from?  Who gives out OUIs?  <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers">IANA</a></p>

<p>What applications that run over HTTP?  Lots of things can be tunneled over HTTP, but most common might be things like RDP (which has its own native remote desktop protocol).</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/week-5-notes-1.jpg" alt="notes" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning">HPKP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a> are trust-on-first-use (TOFU) headers sent by servers to &ldquo;modern&rdquo; web browsers that understand them to signal certain security behaviors.  I made some snarky comments about the &ldquo;<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/refs/heads/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json">preload</a>&rdquo; form of this same data that ships with Chrome.  More secure perhaps but doesn&rsquo;t seem like a great approach to ship static data like this.  <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">Get your own domain listed</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be aware that inclusion in the preload list cannot easily be undone. Domains can be removed, but it takes months for a change to reach users with a Chrome update and we cannot make guarantees about other browsers. Don&rsquo;t request inclusion unless you&rsquo;re sure that you can support HTTPS for your entire site and all its subdomains the long term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We got to talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> and whether they played nicely with firewalls.  A classmate mentions that WebSockets could be used by advertisers to get around standard ad blockers (<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=129353#c58">thread on Chrome-dev</a>)</p>

<p>Question from a classmate: TCP/IP network handling &ndash; what&rsquo;s handled in user space, what&rsquo;s kernel space?</p>

<p>A good article on the topic is Cloudflare&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-use-the-linux-kernels-tcp-stack/">Why we use the Linux kernel&rsquo;s TCP stack</a>, which gives an &ldquo;it depends&rdquo; answer,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latency is very important for the HFT (high frequency trading) folks. Traders can afford custom hardware and fancy proprietary network stacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a side discussion, the question was motivated by thinking of attacks that could be triggered via crafted packets that could exploit the kernel directly.  I like the way you think!  This should be a fairly straight-forward &ldquo;unpacking&rdquo; of ones and zeros from the received network traffic, while keeping a small amount of state off to the side before handling the data off to an application in user-space for heavier processing.</p>

<p>One bit of code that <em>parses</em> network traffic are the packet dissectors we saw in Wireshark in the class.  Each year there are <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/security/">dozens of security issues</a> reported in these dissectors, usually resulting in some denial of service (affecting only the Wireshark application) if its run against a payload with a specially crafted packet.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/bookshelf.jpg" alt="bookshelf" /></p>

<p>I like the first four chapters of <a href="https://hpbn.co">High Performance Browser Networking</a> (free online) for &ldquo;Networking 101&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/week-5-notes-2.jpg" alt="notes" /></p>

<p>Flows through a firewall, permitted in one direction (&ldquo;outbound to an HTTP server on port 80/TCP&rdquo;), with the firewall &ldquo;remembering&rdquo; state to permit the response traffic back from the web server to the ephemeral port on the client without needing a static rule.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a> vs real-world protocols.  Diversity on the top and bottom, TCP/IP in the middle.</p>

<p>Not sure why but we were talking about the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf">Unix Haters Handbook</a> (free online) at some point in the back of the class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know the real trouble with Unix? The real trouble is that it became so
popular. It wasn’t meant to be popular. It was meant for a few folks working
away in their labs, using Digital Equipment Corporation’s old PDP-11
computer. I used to have one of those. A comfortable, room-sized machine.</p>
