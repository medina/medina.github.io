<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>, who keeps an excellent blog, wrote <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/applied_cryptography/">Applied Security</a>, which is an encyclopedia of cryptographic algorithms, but hasn&rsquo;t been updated since 1996.</p>

<p>From the class links, we got to talking about cross-border &ldquo;searches&rdquo; of your personal computing devices (including phones).  This is on par with &ldquo;show me what&rsquo;s in your bag&rdquo;, per case law, although you may not be able to be compelled to turn over passwords.  Also talked about &ldquo;Magic Lantern&rdquo; (again from links), where FBI could didn&rsquo;t bother going through the effort of brute-forcing the keys for encrypted disks.  This segued to an incident following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack">San Bernardino</a> case in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute">FBI wanted access to an encrypted iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>As a thought exercise we got into how they may have eventually gotten access to the device (latest article suggests an exploit may have been used, rather than the clone-and-brute-force method we got into).  Classmate mentions &ldquo;NAN Cloning&rdquo;, and this article about *<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/iphone-hacking-passcodes-nand-mirroring-password">$100 store-bought kit can hack into iPhone passcodes, researcher claims</a> is close to what we discussed.  There&rsquo;s a take-away: the security of the iPhone is proving to hold up well, even when physical access to the device is compromised.</p>

<p>(I can&rsquo;t find the reference to &ldquo;PIN bot&rdquo;, a manual finger-press method, that was mention.)</p>

<p>At some point we got to talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Snowden</a> and two movies were mentioned, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowden_(film)">Snowden</a></em>, the Oliver Stone movie and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenfour">Citizenfour</a></em>, a documentary.</p>

<p>Our media-sector classmate wasn&rsquo;t around so we didn&rsquo;t go too far into <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a href="https://securedrop.org/">SecureDrop</a>.  We did hit upon a bunch of ways that Tor users can be de-anonymized by adversaries like&hellip; the FBI.  In one example, <a href="https://threatpost.com/fbi-mum-on-how-exactly-it-hacked-tor/117127/">they allegedly hacked browsers</a> from compromised sites they controlled.</p>

<p>Someone mentioned another vuln-for-hire case used by a government, where NSO Group&rsquo;s product was <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/">used in the UAE</a>.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/">Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> (VZ DBIR) is coming soon, and in a preview, reports were circulating of a <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/02/13/universitys-iot-devices-went-fishing-for-information-how-did-it-happen/">mass IoT hack at a university</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>We spent some time talking about <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>, which will be used in the more hands-on lab classes in the rest of the program.  You can download this and try it out to get a head start.  Browse the <a href="http://tools.kali.org/tools-listing">bundled tools</a> to find out more about them.  We mentioned there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap between them; nobody knows all of them, you use the ones you know best for the job at hand.  VMPlayer and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> can be used to run virtual machines.</p>

<hr />

<p>We got into audit, with our guest speaker going into some of the different approaches that can be taken with an &ldquo;audit&rdquo; &ndash; the terminology is all over the place and varies depending on the goals.  Is it an &ldquo;audit&rdquo; or an &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;; &ldquo;black box&rdquo; testing vs &ldquo;white box&rdquo; testing (and everything in the middle).</p>

<p>After the Target breach, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/26/lawsuit-against-target-and-trustwave-gets-the-security-standard-all-wrong/">Trustwave was sued</a>.  They were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_Security_Assessor">Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)</a> who allegedly failed to identify issues during their point-in-time review of <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library">PCI DSS</a> compliance.</p>

<p>Talking about what happens when access is not properly managed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_trading_loss">SocGen&rsquo;s rouge trader</a> drove home lessons about segregation of duties.</p>

<p>In an aside we talked about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning">Chelsea Manning</a> who retrieved almost a half-million documents she had authorized access to, but in volumes that exceeded appropriate use of that authorized access.</p>

<p>Side comment about recent Twitter thread re &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/fugueish/status/830638976687960066">pen testing is a lemons market</a>&rdquo; (in a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons">economic sense</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/week-3-notes-2.jpg" alt="week-3-notes-2" /></p>

<p>Somehow got to talking about Bitcoin, robbing cybercurrency, which led to the <a href="https://medium.com/@pullnews/understanding-the-dao-hack-for-journalists-2312dd43e993">Ethereum / DAO hack</a>, which was a protocool-level attack.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember <em>how</em>, but we got to talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Aadhaar/UIDAI</a>, India&rsquo;s country-wide identity-issuance program.</p>

<p>We got into cyberwarefare with mention of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/01/the-new-normal-yet-another-hacker-caused-power-outage-hits-ukraine/">hackers targeting Ukraine&rsquo;s power grid</a>.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia">attacks on Estonia</a> a decade ago were significant and led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn_Manual">Tallinn Manual</a>, a NATO-led study on the topic.</p>

<p>Microsoft recently shared <em><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/">The need for a Digital Geneva Convention</a></em> &ndash; as a classmate quips &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t hack Microsoft&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn">to pwn</a></em>) is Troy Hunt&rsquo;s site to collect information from breaches into a searchable interface so you can know when your accounts are compromised.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/topic/cybersecurity-information-sharing">ISACs</a> are threat-intelligence sharing groups aligned by sector, for example <a href="https://www.fsisac.com/">FS-ISAC</a> for financial services and <a href="http://www.ren-isac.net/">REN-ISAC</a> for universities.  <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/">US-CERT</a> is funded via DHS to provide data-sharing, incident response, and coordination.</p>

<hr />

<p>We talked about cybercrime laws and looked at <a href="http://cybercrime.gov">Cybercrime.gov</a>.</p>

<p>As an assignment, dig up a case, find some of the court filings, and discuss in the next class.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-international-hacker-indicted-massive-attack-us-retail-and-banking-networks">Alleged International Hacker Indicted for Massive Attack on U.S. Retail and Banking Networks</a> is a press release and <a href="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2009/08/gonzalez.pdf">USA vs Gonzalez</a> is the indictment filed in court.</p>
